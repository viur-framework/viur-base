## About

`viur-base` is a template for new ViUR projects and already comes with a default setting to quickly start coding.<br>
The repository is intended to serve as a template, therefore feel free to remove any stuff from it to fit your specific
project demands.

## Requirements

Before you start, please check out the following preliminaries are met:

1. You either need Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL. See [awesome-viur](https://github.com/viur-framework/awesome-viur#tutorials--examples) for further help and information for specific operating systems.
2. `git`, `python >= 3.10` and `pipenv` should be installed
3. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) with `app-engine-python` and `app-engine-python-extras` components (see [here](https://docs.viur.dev/latest/start.html#prerequisites) for further help)

## Usage

1. Create a new Google Cloud project [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and activate billing.
   
    > We will refer to the name of the project you created as `YOUR-APP-ID`.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base.git YOUR-PROJECT`.

    > This creates a new local folder `YOUR-PROJECT`. In most cases, `YOUR-PROJECT` and `YOUR-APP-ID` should be identical.
3. `cd YOUR-PROJECT`
4. `./clean-base.py -A YOUR-APP-ID`
5. `./viur-gcloud-setup.sh YOUR-APP-ID`
6. Install local development dependencies with `pipenv install --dev`
7. Locally run your project with `pipenv run viur run` or deploy it with `pipenv run viur deploy app`. Run a `pipenv shell` to work with the [viur-cli](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-cli) command line tool.
