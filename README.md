# ViUR base

**viur-base** provides a basic ViUR project structure and template.<br>
This is the best place to start a new ViUR project from!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, please check out the following system prerequisites:

1. `git`, `python >= 3.9` and `pipenv` should be installed
2. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) with `app-engine-python` and `app-engine-python-extras` components (see [here](https://docs.viur.dev/latest/start.html#prerequisites) for further help)

## Start a new project

1. Create a new Google Cloud project [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and activate billing
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base.git YOUR-PROJECT`
3. `cd YOUR-PROJECT`
4. `./clean-base.py -A YOUR-APP-ID`
5. `./viur-gcloud-setup.sh YOUR-APP-ID`

## Clean git history

It is recommended to clean the git history before you push your new project to a remote git repository. This can easily be done with

```bash
$ git checkout --orphan fresh  # create new orphaned branch with empty history
$ git branch -D main  # remove old viur-base main
```

After it, you can branch main from fresh again and remove fresh.
